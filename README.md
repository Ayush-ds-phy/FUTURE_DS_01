🚀 Power BI E-Commerce Sales Dashboard | Internship Project

As part of a real-world data analytics internship, I designed and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard using e-commerce sales data, with the goal of helping business stakeholders make smarter, data-driven decisions.

🔍 Project Objective:
To uncover insights such as:

🛒 Best-selling products and categories

📆 Monthly and seasonal sales trends

🌍 Region-wise revenue breakdown

📊 Customer behavior patterns

✅ My Contributions:

Cleaned and transformed raw sales data (Excel/CSV formats) to ensure analysis-ready datasets

Used Power Query and DAX to create KPIs, time-series charts, and category-based comparisons

Built an intuitive dashboard featuring slicers for time, regions, and categories for easy navigation

Presented findings with business recommendations to simulate a real-world client presentation

🎯 Skills Gained:

Data cleaning & transformation

Time series and trend analysis

DAX for calculated measures and custom KPIs

Excel & Power BI integration

💼 This dashboard now serves as a template for future interns, enabling them to learn data analytics through hands-on experience while supporting organizational insights.
